COP 3503 Project 3 Report

Conor Landry, Ryan Wolf, Adrien Nelson, Keanu Kerr

  Project 3 taught us a number of important things that go beyond programming
practice. For our snake game, we incorporated SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
to render the snake, food, powerups, and the main menu. This was our first
foray into game creation for all of us. More importantly, we learned how to use
collaboration tools to work in a team. We used GitHub to keep our final product
available to everyone while simultaneously allowing all of us to work on
 individual pieces of the program. It was our first time using GitHub, and we
 figured out how to use it very effectively. It made for a very organized work
 experience, and will probably be useful in our careers down the road. Being
 able to see everyone else's progress allowed us to continue to work on the
 program on our own time, and made it easier to implement changes without
 having to constantly notify each other.

  In our future work, we will have to continue to learn new programming
languages and other tools to be able to work on other projects. Learning how to
use SDL put us through a similar process to what we might have to do for a
future endeavor. GitHub or similar tools will also most likely be used for
our futur careers in programming. Being able to work in teams is one of the
most important qualities in the field, and helps get projects finished in a
much more efficient and timely manner. Flexibility and the ability to
 work with others are qualities that can make or break someone's career in
 programming, and in the process of completing this project, we have all
 proven that we these qualities can be attributed to our team.
